# AI-Powered-Excel-Mock-Interviewer
The AI-Powered Excel Mock Interviewer is an autonomous system that evaluates a candidateâ€™s Excel skills via a structured, intelligent, multi-turn interview. Unlike traditional manual interviews, this system provides consistent, scalable, and unbiased assessment, making the hiring process faster and more data-driven.

It simulates a real Excel interview, evaluates answers in real-time using AI, tracks performance, and generates detailed feedback reports.

## Problem Statement
Business Context

The organization is expanding Finance, Operations, and Data Analytics divisions. Excel proficiency is critical for new hires. Current challenges include:

Manual interviews are time-consuming and inconsistent.

Senior analysts spend excessive time in pre-screening.

Hiring pipeline slows, affecting organizational growth.

Goal: Build an AI-driven system to automatically assess Excel skills efficiently and consistently.


# Technology Stack & Justifications
Component	Choice	Justification

**Python 3.11**

Wide ecosystem for AI, ML, and data handling. Supports modern libraries, maintainable, and widely used in enterprise.

**Streamlit: UI Framework**

Interactive dashboards with session state. Supports real-time UI updates (timer, question navigation) without complex frontend frameworks.

**JSON-based Question Storage: Data Storage**

Lightweight, portable, and easily extensible. Tracks question usage, effectiveness, and candidate performance.

**LLM Integration (OpenAI/Gemini): AI Evaluation**

Allows semantic evaluation of open-ended responses. Capable of generating feedback and scoring based on correctness and completeness.

**Dynamic Question Bank: Template + Seed Questions**

Solves cold-start problem; templates auto-generate diverse questions, seed questions provide initial reliability.

Rationale:
All choices prioritize fast prototyping, low friction deployment, and scalability, while ensuring that AI evaluation is both data-driven and interpretable.

## Question Bank Design

basic_formulas:	SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT ->	Finance, Operations

lookup_functions:	VLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH ->	Finance, Data Analytics

data_analysis:	PIVOT, FILTER, SORT ->	Operations, Data Analytics

advanced_formulas:	IF, SUMIF, COUNTIF ->	Data Analytics, Finance

data_manipulation:	CONCATENATE, TEXT, DATE	-> Operations

scenario_based:	DASHBOARD, REPORTING ->	Finance, Operations

Why:
Categorizing ensures role-specific focus, which increases relevance and reduces noise in evaluation.

# AI Evaluation Methodology

**Semantic Scoring:** Uses LLM to check answer correctness, completeness, and context.

**Keyword Matching:** For structured formulas, extracts Excel functions to ensure precise evaluation.

**Hybrid Scoring:** Combines numeric scoring (0â€“100) with textual feedback for candidates.

**Performance Tracking:** Updates usage_count, avg_score, success_rate, and effectiveness_score for each question.

# Timer & Session Handling

**Per-question timer** with countdown display

Auto-advance on timeout to prevent stalling

Streamlit **session state** used for storing:

  -Current question index
  
  -Candidate responses
  
  -Timer state


# ðŸ“ˆ Analytics & Reporting

**Question Metrics:** usage, avg_score, success_rate, effectiveness

**Role-wise Analysis:** identifies top and low-performing questions

**Candidate Summary Report:**

  -Question-wise performance
  
  -Strengths & weaknesses
  
  -Suggested improvement points


## Cold Start Strategy

Challenge: No pre-existing Excel interview dataset.

Solution:

**Template-based question generation:** Covers common Excel tasks

**Seed questions:** 5â€“10 verified questions per category

**Performance-driven refinement:** Candidate interactions update effectiveness scores

**Iterative improvement:** Questions with low effectiveness replaced or updated

Why:
Allows a scalable, self-learning system even without initial datasets.

##  Future Enhancements

- **PDF Feedback Generation** â€“ Export detailed performance reports for candidates in a shareable PDF format.
  
- **Integration with Zoom / Microsoft Teams** â€“ Enable real-time interviews directly within popular video conferencing platforms.
  
- **Multi-Language Support** â€“ Allow candidates to take interviews in their preferred language for inclusivity.
    
- **Voice-based Q&A System** â€“ Integrate speech-to-text (for candidate responses) and text-to-speech (for interviewer questions) to simulate more natural, human-like interviews.
  
- **Advanced ML Evaluation** â€“ Use predictive ML models to score responses without relying solely on LLM API calls, reducing latency and cost.
  
- **HR Dashboard with Analytics** â€“ Provide recruiters with an admin dashboard that includes aggregate insights, candidate comparisons, and skill distribution trends.
